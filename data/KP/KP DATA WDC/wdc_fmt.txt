Availability

The most recent kpyymm.wdc (yymm stands for year and month, each expressed
with two digits) files are distributed per e-mail half-monthly by

Both recent and past tables (since 1932) are supplied as an archive on the
FTP servers

     Germany: ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/
     Denmark: ftp://ftp.space.dtu.dk/WDC/indices/kp-ap/

Preliminaries

We use the standard format as published by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado.

Caution:

   * the columns for the solar radio flux (columns 66-71) are not reported from
     2007 onwards
   * the list of most quiet and most disturbed days is not contained in this
     format; if you need those, please refer to the other tables
     (kpyymm.tab)
   * we do not guarantee the correctness of the international sunspot number
     R; these values are published separately (Brussels, Belgium)
   * note that the sunspot number calculation has been changed by WDC-SILSO,
     Royal Observatory of Belgium, on July 2015, affecting sunspot numbers from
     January 2015.
   * sunspot numbers are not reported from 2015 onwards

Selected Geomagnetic and Solar Activity Indices

Worldwide Indices

The subscript p means planetary and designates a global magnetic activity
index. The following 13 observatories now contribute to the planetary
indices: Lerwick (UK), Eskdalemuir (UK), Hartland (UK), Ottawa (Canada),
Fredericksburg (USA), Meanook (Canada), Sitka (USA), Eyrewell (New Zealand),
Canberra (Australia), Lovo (Sweden), Brorfelde (Denmark), Wingst and Niemegk
(Germany).

Three-hour-range Index Kp

Ks indices isolate solar particle effects on the earth's magnetic field;
over a 3-hour period, they classify into disturbance levels the range of
variation of the more unsettled horizontal field component. Each activity
level relates almost logarithmically to its corresponding disturbance
amplitude. Three-hour indices discriminate conservatively between true
magnetic field perturbations and the quiet-day variations produced by
ionospheric currents.

Ks indices range in 28 steps from 0 (quiet) to 9 (greatly disturbed) with
fractional parts expressed in thirds of a unit. A Ks-value equal to 27, for
example, means 2 and 2/3 or 3-; a Ks-value equal to 30 means 3 and 0/3 or 3
exactly; and a Ks-value equal to 33 means 3 and 1/3 or 3+. The arithmetic
mean of the Ks values scaled at the 13 observatories listed above gives Kp.

Equivalent Amplitude ap

The ap-index ranges from 0 to 400 and represents a Kp-value converted to a
linear scale in nT (nanoTesla) - a scale that measures equivalent
disturbance amplitude of a station at which K=9 has a lower limit of 400 nT.
